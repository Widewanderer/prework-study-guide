# Prework study guide for Vanderbilt Fullstack Programming Bootcamp

## Description

This study guide was created in 2023 for the Vanderbult Fullstack Programming Bootcamp. Topics covered include HTML,CSS, JavaScript, and Git. This site was built as part of project to learn the basics of web-building. Previously, I have worked with HTML and JavaScript but never to creat an entire website. It is crude yet is a harbinger of greater things to come. Ideally it will be upgraded in the future.
